Ideas


1: Layered vectors
      
      My concept here is that I utilize a the top vector to store all the words that need to be type as
      a vector of strings. The bottom vector is the top vector but converted into chars, the idea here
      is that I can take a paragraph and input it to the large vector and have it mutated/broken down
      into chars. This way I can check individual current characters as I am typing.
